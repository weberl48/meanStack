#Basic Routing In Node Applications
  The Express Router can be used to add more pages to a site. This is a basic example but its format for routing will be used on later examples to build out a RESTful API that a front-end (Angular, React, Polymer) can use.
###Express Router
  - Provides the routing APIs .use(), .get(), .param(), .route()
  - support for multiple instances allows for applications to be more modular and flexible.
        This example calls an instance of the router used for an adminPage and applies routes to the adminPage instance.
